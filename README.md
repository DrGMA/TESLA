TESLA: a Tool for Automatic Earthquake Low‐Frequency Spectral Level estimAtion

TESLA is designed to invert the P- and S-displacement spectra searching the optimal signal
window to use for the spectral analysis. Using a signal window of fixed duration,
although variable according to the earthquake magnitude, is not always the appropri-
ate choice, especially when microseismicity is analyzed. TESLA performs three main
tasks for both P and S phases: (1) a systematic exploration of several signal windows
to use for the computation of displacement spectra, (2) the spectral analysis for all the
selected signal windows, and (3) the evaluation of the best-displacement spectra
through quantitative criteria and the estimation of the low-frequency spectral levels.

The latest version of TESLA will be released soon. 
I'm sorry, but the package is under construction.  
Please, send me an email (guidomaria.adinolfi@unito.it) 
if you want to be notified when the package will be available on GitHub.
