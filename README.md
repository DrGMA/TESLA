## Overview üìú
TESLA (Tool for Automatic Earthquake Low-Frequency Spectral Level Estimation) is a Python-based tool designed to optimize the spectral analysis of earthquake waveforms. It focuses on low-frequency spectral level estimation by adapting signal window selection based on the signal complexity. By inverting the P- and S-displacement spectra, TESLA identifies the optimal signal window for spectral analysis, moving beyond traditional fixed-duration signal windows to offer more accurate analysis, especially for microseismicity.

## Features üöÄ
- **Automatic Signal Window Selection** : TESLA automates the selection process of signal windows, ensuring the spectral analysis is as precise as possible by considering the effect of earthquake's magnitude and the  characteristics of microseismic waveforms.
- **Systematic Exploration** : The tool systematically explores various signal windows, performing a comprehensive analysis to compute the displacement spectra for both P and S phases.
- **Comprehensive Spectral Analysis** : Evaluates all selected signal windows to conduct in-depth spectral analyses and calculate displacement spectra.
- **Quantitative Evaluation** : Utilizes quantitative criteria to select the best displacement spectra, offering accurate estimates of low-frequency spectral levels.

## Purpose üéØ
TESLA enhances low-frequency spectral level estimation by systematically selecting signal windows, overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-duration window methods, especially in the analysis of microseismicity. TESLA enhances seismic event analysis, especially for low magnitude events, by providing additional observables such as P and S low-frequency spectral levels. These insights can refine focal mechanism constraints together with P-wave polarities and facilitate seismic moment and moment magnitude estimations.

## Advantages :trophy:

- **Open Source** : Written in Python, TESLA is freely available for seismic research.
- **Modular Architecture** : Designed for easy modifications to meet specific research needs.
- **Highly Configurable** : Fine-tune TESLA's settings for varied processing needs, making it a versatile tool for seismic data analysis.
